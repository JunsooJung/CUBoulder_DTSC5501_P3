        "To solve a problem that requires finding the shortest path between two points in a graph, you need to implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. You have the choice to use any data structure for representing the graph: edge list, adjacency list, adjacency matrix, etc. However, it's important to maintain consistency throughout. The weight of each connection in the graph should represent the time taken to traverse it and can be a float/decimal value.\n",

The second scenario is the rush hour with high traffic, which causes delays on most routes (not all of them). Your evaluation of both scenarios should incorporate some level of uncertainty. This means that a route can be blocked or delayed by 10 times or more. To make it more realistic, you need to identify at least three pairs of nodes that may encounter such a situation.\n",

Evaluate each case (node1->Node2) and apply your own base modification. Use the random library to solve this impact.\n",

The change modifies the weights of the graph's edges at random, which adds uncertainty. By increasing the edge's weight, the alteration is done to approximate a 20% possibility of a \"unlike event\" occurring.\n",

        "1. The Event class is defined to represent the graph and perform the Dijkstra algorithm.\n",
        "2. In the __init__ method, the number of vertices is initialized and an adjacency matrix is created to represent the graph.\n",

        "4. The printPath method is used to recursively print the shortest path from the source vertex to a given destination vertex.\n",

        "* In each iteration, it selects the vertex with the minimum distance from the source vertex that is not yet included in the shortest path tree.\n",
        "* If the selected vertex is the destination vertex, the algorithm terminates.\n",
        "* For each adjacent vertex to the selected vertex, the algorithm calculates a modified weight based on a random factor (simulating the uncertainty) and original weight.\n",
        "* If the modified weight is non-zero and the adjacent vertex is not yet included in the shortest path tree and the distance to the adjacent vertex can be reduced by going through the selected vertex, the algorithm updates the distance and parent arrays.\n",

        "* Finally, it prints the shortest path from the source to the destination vertex.\n",
